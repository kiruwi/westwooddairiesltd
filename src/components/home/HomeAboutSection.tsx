        Westwood Dairies began with one simple idea: good milk should taste like home. So we
        work with <span className="highlight-jagged">well-kept cows</span> and keep the process
        simple. Every day we turn fresh milk into yogurt, ice cream and maziwa lala right here.
        With <span className="highlight-jagged">no unnecessary additives</span>, what reaches you
        is clean, honest dairy. Bring it home and share it with the people you love.
